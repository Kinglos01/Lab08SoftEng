     * Hello prof I used a factory software design for this program however,
     * I don't know how you wanted the information to be accessed so I currently
     * have it set so you can search by style and then type if needed I could add
     * any search criteria to this program.  I also was confused on what you meant
     * by driver class so I made a class with nothing but calling main.  I was torn between
     * making main driver or making this separate class.  Thanks.
     * Sincerely,
